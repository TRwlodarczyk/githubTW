We will focus on Open Data, Open Source, and Open Methodology. One component that was added additionally to the chart is Open Process. It links a lot of Open Science pieces together. It was created in response to the Reproducibility Crisis when researchers have begun to advocate for preregistration of studies (Learn More abour Preregistration). This involes writing out and publishing the entire research plan to avoid practices like p-hacking or HARKing. Preregistration separates hypothesis-generating  (exploratory) from hypothesis-testing (confirmatory) research. Both are important. But the same data cannot be used to generate and test a hypothesis.</p>"}]}
