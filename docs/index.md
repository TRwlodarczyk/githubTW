## Structure

The repository aims to represent a well structured page for a research tool following [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and [CARE](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/5da9f4479ecab221ce848fb2/1571419335217/CARE+Principles_One+Pagers+FINAL_Oct_17_2019.pdf) principles. In addition, the resporitory tries to follow best practices for project management, data management, version control and documentation with the goal of being reproducible for collaborators and potential contributors.

Each of the aims discussed above are associated with their specific FOSS lessons:

- [Managing Data](https://foss.cyverse.org/03_managing_data/)
- [Project Management](https://foss.cyverse.org/02_project_management/)
- [Documentation and Communication](https://foss.cyverse.org/04_documentation_communication/)
- [Version Control](https://foss.cyverse.org/05_version_control/)
- [Reproducibility](https://foss.cyverse.org/06_reproducibility_i/)
