# Introduction to Open Science

!!! Info "Learning Objectives"
        After this lesson, learners should be able to:
        
        1.  Describe and discuss features of Open Science
        2.  Understand the structure of the FOSS workshop and final project
        3.  Describe the core platforms and capabailities of CyVerse and learn more about them

## What is Open Science?

Open Science isn't necessarily a set of checkboxes you need to tick, but rather an holistic approach to doing
science. Open Science can be very different across domains, based on both cultural expectations and logistical limitations such
as data privacy. In the context of research, open science helps to balance between getting it right over getting it published.

### Components of Open Science

The most fundamental component of Open Science is the accessibility of data. Without that, everything else falls apart.

The diagram represents core pieces of Open Science beyond making data accessible. We will focus on Open Data, Open Source, and Open Methodology.
One component that was added additionally to the chart is Open Process. It links a lot of Open Science pieces together. It was created in response to the Reproducibility Crisis when researchers have begun to advocate for **preregistration** of studies ([Learn More abour Preregistration](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg#:~:text=What%20is%20Preregistration%3F,Both%20are%20important.)). This involes writing out and publishing the entire research plan to avoid practices like [p-hacking](https://embassy.science/wiki/Theme:6b584d4e-2c9d-4e27-b370-5fbdb983ab46#:~:text=P%2Dvalue%20hacking%2C%20also%20known,there%20is%20no%20underlying%20effect.) or [HARKing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15647155/). Preregistration separates hypothesis-generating  (exploratory) from hypothesis-testing (confirmatory) research. Both are important. But the same data cannot be used to generate and test a hypothesis.
